Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the three model architectures did not classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed. The ResNet architecture classified it as a "german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian," while the other two architectures did not provide a specific breed classification for Dog_01.jpg.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the three model architectures did not classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg. The ResNet architecture classified both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as dogs, but it misclassified Dog_02.jpg as a "malinois" breed instead of correctly identifying it as a "german shepherd".


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified Cat_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg as not being dogs. There were no misclassifications reported for these images.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Resnet and alexnet model architectures performed the best as both outputs were the same given equal time resources. ResNet architecture provided more specific breed classifications compared to the other two architectures.
